    <h2>TheTake</h2>
    <p>I have a passion for the future of multimedia experiences. In my current role, I create those experiences. I design and develop augmented video experiences that sit on top of existing network video solutions</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <h4>What we do</h4>
    <p>At TheTake, we serve two purposes: enable the TV/movie studio to monetize their content with highly relevant contextual ads and help the user to identify the product they see on screen. How this happens is highly dependent on your viewing device and the content owner. We run on set top boxes as an extra feature for on-demand movies, smart TVs, TV studio websites, entertainment/celebrity news sites, movie trailer sites, and more. Our experience identifying products and building a massive database of products and images has enabled us to create <a href="http://thetake.ai/" target="_blank">neural networks</a> that can identify people, clothing, and other things - scene-by-scene - in an automated way.</p>

    <h3>The Team</h3>
    <p>
      Our UX design and front-end dev team consists of two people.<br>
      <span class="bold">Me</span>: ideation, wireframes, rough mockups, animated mockups, software prototype development (some backend, JavaScript, CSS), prototype testing, user interviews, A/B tests (design, plan data architecture and data points, instrument/code, analyze data), telemetry analysis<br>

      Sorry, your browser does not support the video tag :-(
    </video>

    <h4>Evolution of the tagged video UI</h4>
    <p>Our viewer interface has evolved a bit since the beginning. Usability and A/B testing, feedback from network execs/UX designers/lawyers, feedback from partner marketers, and more has shaped the product to what it is today.</p>
    <p>The first iteration of our product overlaid <span class="bold">dots</span> on top of the products seen on screen; you could hover over them to see more details or click them to launch a modal to buy it or shop similar products in a lower price range. Obviously this approach could only be used on pause because it completely cluttered the screen, but what really caused us to move on was the legal concerns of the studios because this overlay might imply an actor was endorsing a product.</p>
    <iframe class="youtube half" style="width:400px;max-width:100%;" width="500" height="224" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WOtf9PD48V0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The next version dropped the dots in favor of a more removed listing of products. We wanted an interface that didn’t obscure the content and that could potentially run while the content is playing. We landed on a <span class="bold">list of bubbles</span> that expands/contracts on hover or pause.</p>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/bubbles.jpg" data-fancybox="background" data-caption="Designs for expanding bubbles: condensed view available on hover"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/bubbles-small.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Bubbles</p></div></a></div>
    <a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/iphone-ui.gif" data-fancybox="background" data-caption="Designs for expanding bubbles: condensed view available on hover"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/iphone-ui-thumb.gif"></a>
    <p>This new interface had engagement issues. The data made it seem like most people accidentally expanded the bubble list and never touched it after that. The bubbles alone were very bare and provided no context as to what they were (unless one was of a product very prominent on screen while engaged), so we added <span class="bold">guidance banners</span> that disappeared upon hover. They also reappeared at select points in the video to attract attention to a <span class="bold">look of the night</span> - this in particular played well with one network’s audience for reality programming but did nothing for another network’s scripted shows.</p>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/fly-in.jpg" data-fancybox="background" data-caption="Designs for fly-out clothing: gives a preview of what's in the episode"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/fly-in-small.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Fly-Out Outfits</p></div></a></div>

    <p>The data showed that a majority of users went full screen at some point during their sessions. An evaluation of the full screen experience brought to light that the bubbles could be potentially too diminutive on a larger screen and due to their contextual nature provided limited utility (only what’s on screen) so users would quickly forget it was even there. Because of this, we introduced a <span class="bold">full screen experience</span> for browsing all the outfits in the video at one time, while the video still played.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="psect">
    <h3>The Next Version</h3>
    <p>We got feedback from our partners and started getting requirements from potential new ones. This sparked a more serious redesign rather than our incremental, A/B testing approach for many of the previous changes described here. We did on-site user tests to get a feel for how people who were new to the product were using the interface. We synthesized this data into the following goals:</p>
    <div class="prompt">
      <ul style="text-align:left">
        <li>Less like an ad, more like a feature</li>
        <li>Integrate seamlessly into existing UI<span style="font-size: 22px;">s</span></li>
        <li>Key metrics: drive clicks vs views</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>As I mentioned, the full screen experience was our latest redesign. The user testing showed that people had issues with the placement of the button that launches the experience: too small of a target, moves away if you overshoot it with the mouse. We tried many designs and settled on one that was less problematic, but also unfortunately made it seem like the button was a label for the expanding bubbles.</p>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/fs-shop-btn.jpg" data-fancybox="next" data-caption="Designs for the button that launches the full screen outfit shopping experience"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/fs-shop-btn-small.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Full Screen Shopping Button</p></div></a></div>
    <p>Further iterations on this full screen experience included: inserting our own custom icon into the studio playbar that launches the experience (integrating better with their UI too), launching the experience automatically during the credits and also when you pause in full screen, and autoscrolling the experience to the top outfit currently on screen when it is launched. The icon got practically no engagement. Auto launching the experience saw an uptick in engagement but not a lot; it seems that this A/B test audience is highly resistant to engaging with features outside of the primary task at hand. Autoscrolling yielded no noticeable gains.</p>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/pb-icon.jpg" data-fancybox="next" data-caption="Designs for a custom playbar icon that launches the full screen outfit shopping experience"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/pb-icon-small.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Custom Playbar Icon</p></div></a></div>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/pb-icon-opts.jpg" data-fancybox="next" data-caption="Many options for a custom playbar icon that launches the full screen outfit shopping experience"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/pb-icon-opts-small.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Icon Options</p></div></a></div>
    <p>All our testing and product telemetry suggested that our biggest issue was getting people to engage with the product in the first place. People who used it and understood what it was had really high engagement. Users reported initially reading the overlay as an ad, so they ignored it entirely. To achieve the goal of <span class="bold">less like an ad, more like a feature</span> we started reimagining our interface as something that is a seamless part of the player’s interface/chrome.</p>
    <p>We also started getting more partners that wanted to integrate us into their set-top boxes/smart TVs/TV apps, meaning we needed an interface that worked well for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-foot_user_interface" target="_blank">10 foot experience</a>. They also requested that additional metadata be shown alongside the product data (like music, locations, actor info, etc.). Our primary goal was still <span class="uline">identifying the products you see and showing you where to get them</span>, but adding this other functionality allowed us to better position it as a feature to the end-user. Furthermore, these changes would allow us to bring our interface in line with the typical video player interface seen on TV-attached devices today, hopefully reducing the barrier to teaching users what our stuff is and how to use it.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="psect">
    <h3>Afterword</h3>
    <p>We are still testing iterations on the new playbar design and A/B testing against the control (our old expanding bubbles look). Engagement is actually higher with the new design - for those who use the feature at all. The click through rate, overall, is about the same for both designs. Since product <span class="bold">views</span> are counted differently (hover for old design, click for new design) there is now more intent behind a product view - which explains the fact that the new design converts more product views into buy clicks (user clicks through to a merchant site to buy the product). Both <span class="bold">views and buys</span> can be monetized, so it’s important to measure both; obviously, a buy has more purchase intent so it is more valuable to merchants.</p>
    <p>The real problem is that less people are engaging with our product with the new design. No great insight has been revealed as to why that is, but we are in the process of testing some designs focused around engagement. When tagged products first appear on screen, we have in the past (with good success) used special intro animations to call attention to our features; likewise, we have used the <span class="bold">look of the night</span> to grab attention later in the video. Here we try to bring those to this new design. Quick and dirty mockups of animation were made in PowerPoint.</p>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2fE4WRTRfo" data-fancybox="afterword" data-caption="When the user hits a tagged song in the video, a notification plays to pull them back into the shoppable experience"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/yt-m2fE4WRTRfo.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Music Playing Notification</p></div></a></div>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGqffDxG2_8" data-fancybox="afterword" data-caption="When the video starts, this callout gives context as to what the playbar interface is"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/yt-qGqffDxG2_8.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Video Start Guidance</p></div></a></div>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/pb-lotn.jpg" data-fancybox="afterword" data-caption="Designs for bringing 'look of the night' callouts to the new playbar design"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/pb-lotn-small.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>Playbar Look of the Night</p></div></a></div>
    <p>The end of the episode presents an opportunity to capture users once they have finished their primary goal (watching the video). <span class="bold">End cards</span> are used elsewhere in the video player industry to surface additional/related video, ads, etc. We are creating some experiments to test this here - against the control (old design) which automatically pops up the full screen experience in the credits.</p>
    <div class="graphic"><a href="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/end-card.jpg" data-fancybox="afterword" data-caption="Designs for an 'end card' that appears when the video has ended, trying to capture the viewer's attention when they are no longer focused on the video"><img src="http://cdn.carljamilkowski.com/thetake/img/end-card-small.jpg"><div class="desc"><p>End Card</p></div></a></div>
    <p>Finally, a design to tweak the way products are surfaced to the user in the playbar is primed for testing after these other tests are complete. Since the bubbles don’t change while the playbar is open/visible, the user doesn’t know that there is more data to explore at that time - but we could notify them that new outfits are available to be seen. This helps capture users who are dismissing the interface as unimportant because of its static look.</p>
