<p>Sick, savage, and sensual, Ian came out of his mother at the age of 0 in 1984.  A writer and actor, he went to public school before going to college, with a Bar Mitzvah in the middle around the age of 13.  His dearth of self-image problems, lack of shame, and desire for attention his little sister selfishly stole from him upon her birth combined with his tendency to notice the obvious and comment in a sarcastic fashion in addition to his ability to write unnecessarily long (yet grammatically correct) sentences led him to pursue a career in acting, namely comedy.  He graduated from Pace University&rsquo;s prestigious Pace University&rsquo;s Program For The Actor in 2006 with a B.F.A., has studied with both The People&rsquo;s Improv Theater and The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, and is currently in a tumultuous on-again/off-again relationship with his sixth girlfriend, Ego.  He currently resides in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.</p>
