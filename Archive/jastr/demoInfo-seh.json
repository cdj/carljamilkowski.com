		"0LoC" : "<h4>Preventive Care</h4>Jastr's hardware solutions are integrated into a comprehensive platform which facilitates interactions with providers at all levels of health care. The platform effectively becomes the first point of contact for any health interaction. By giving users a more significant role in making informed decisions about their own health, Jastr's technology is designed to keep clients out of the hospital.",
		"syncing" : "<h4>Personalization</h4>Uploading data to Jastr's mobile platform via the wireless Bluetooth connection enables users to share data with health providers or simply track and analyze their data using Jastr's software tools. Personalized medicine starts with personal information, and Jastr overcomes the tendency for providers and insurers to unnecessarily overcharge for health outcomes by guiding users towards bundled care and relevant procedures.",
		"timelineView" : "<h4>Data Tracking</h4>As data is logged using Jastr's hardware devices, the software platform seamlessly displays that information in meaningful ways to help users identify patterns or anomalies worth discussing with a health care provider—making self-quantified data, clinically relevant.",
		"healthRiskWarning" : "<h4>Predictive Analytics</h4>Through the analysis of quantified-self data collected by Jastr's software-enabled hardware, the mobile platform assesses your health even if you do not have time to. Progress tracking and trend analysis tools help users better understand the severity of their condition, and enable them to decide when to seek care and what type is most appropriate.",
		"lightSensitive" : "<h4>Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data</h4>Self-evaluation and reporting of pain levels (symptomatic) may be logged and compared with other measured data such as light sensitivity (asymptomatic) levels. Because Jastr's analytics ultimately use this and other data to develop numerical health indicators, qualitative data must be converted into quantitative data to drive those analyses. Jastr aims to use machine learning coupled with human interaction to simplify both symptomatic as well as asymptomatic health information.",

Jastr aims to use machine learning coupled with human interaction to simplify both symptomatic as well as asymptomatic health information.",
		"effeciency" : "<h4>Comparing Data Sets</h4>Jastr provides tools to compare multiple sets of data, such as light sensitivity and productivity, to illustrate convergent trends and cross correlation. The cumulative evaluation of these data sets is then used to develop health indicators for broad evaluations of an individual's condition.",

		"0LoC" : "<h4>Decentralization of Health Data</h4>Data collected by Jastr's hardware can be made readily available to providers or simply analyzed using tools in the mobile interface. This new access and ownership of data empowers users to make more informed decisions; just one way Jastr is decentralizing and personalizing care to improve user health experiences.",
		"syncing" : "<h4>Wireless Communication</h4>Uploading data to Jastr's mobile platform through a wireless Bluetooth connection allows users to share data on the go.",
