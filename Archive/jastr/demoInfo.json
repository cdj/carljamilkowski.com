	 "description" : "Jastr’s quantified model across five levels of care takes on an intuitive and logical step towards understanding how to enable holistic diagnostic differentials on a breakthrough platform. The platform creates a new approach to integrated health, interoperability, relational architecture, and portability while fine-tuning and advancing personalization at the consumer level.",

		"home" : "<h3>Drive User Storage</h3>Jastr uses quantified data and visualization to encourage users to get the most of the 5LoC platform by increasing input of health data across all levels. We also enable easy discovery tools through search and navigation that has not been achieved.",
		"tab0" : "<h3>Disruptive Value Network</h3>The binary care level not only pushes forward digital health but also aims to securely enable digital health to move from a disruptive innovation towards a sustaining innovation. Jastr’s platform is the disruptive value network that will put consumer technologies on the same playing field as incumbent services.",
		"tab1" : "<h3>Steer Mobile-First Thinking</h3>Poor incentives drive primary care providers in a brick and mortar setting to become increasingly specialized; this is no different than the current obsession with specialties (the wrong direction). Instead, Jastr’s primary care level advances their ability to shift towards a mobile-first solution in order to drive down costs and in- crease consumer value in the right direction.",
		"tab2" : "<h3>Codify the Non-Obvious</h3>Jastr’s secondary level of care meets the non-obvious need to have leaders who understand the need for organization, pragmatic design, and clarity. While incumbents argue about politically correct scope of care, Jastr will build technology to let consumers drive usability and clear up the blurred lines between health services.",
		"tab3" : "<h3>Defy Market Trends</h3>By virtue of making tertiary care health products and services available to all consumers, Jastr aims to go against current market trends of high costs affiliated with specialization and poor incentives driven by medical marketing. Instead, Jastr’s model enables integrated care across all levels, a logical step towards clinically invasive processes, and definition despite complexity of tertiary products and services.",
		"tab4" : "<h3>Democratize Innovation</h3>Innovation is all around us, sometimes, it is not just well dispersed. Jastr’s vision for quaternary care is to not only enable more access to what makes our health care system so innovative but also, push the experimental, clinical, and innovative to move with cloud computing technologies and Jastr’s platform lens.",
		"end" : "<h3>Quantify Health Status</h3>Truly aligned incentives starts with a platform that never compromises on data-driven outcomes. Lack of due diligence from health organizations to reimagine data value is solved by consumer en- gagement. Appropriation of health is solved by in- stant deduction of over- use and underuse of health services on a per- sonalized level. Lucid nu- merical thresholds can drive problems of trans- parency and compliant behavior. And signs of negligence can be as- sessed at the forefront of basic communication messaging."}},

	 "description" : "Jastr’s vision is to move health and medicine away from being a practice and more into data-driven field of science. At the core of any product or service is the choice for weighing value—ergo, this is where we’ll build a core algorithmic and machine learning competency. The ability to define value through both qualitative and quantitative terms is a feat not too many startups are chasing and is neither one that is being used to drive consumer-driven choices by incumbents. We choose to deliver and create value through this disconnect.",

One way to have stakeholders speak the same language is to design ways to mutually identify with the same symbols through the same functional design.",
		"screen2" : "<h3>Crowdsource, Index, and Repeat</h3>Transparency, ranking, and indexing quality of products and services are not mutually exclusive in search engines on the web so why are they in health? Because for a long time, lack of transparency was a tool to drive profitability. The only way to enable a defined contribution for value amongst health stakeholders is to rebuild those databases from scratch.",

Jastr’s vision is to develop the consumer into their primary resource and their provider as secondary- this subtle change will advance the economics of health in favor of more supporting roles, enabled by technology.",
		"screen10" : "<h3>Financial Health Management</h3>Payments in health have yet to be affected by cost-cutting technologies and innovation—while the cost of care has increased significantly. Jastr believes that the turn towards managed health will only be advanced when the flexibility of transactions can match.",

When it comes to partnering with financial health partnerships. Like PayPal, Venmo, and Square: Jastr will allow for health payments to be done through the Internet and not paper based checks or slow reimbursement approvals; we will enable reoccurring transaction management and data portability –building new hardware and software to allow consumers to drive low-cost transactions and pro- active interaction to incumbent stakeholders.",

Jastr’s system makes it possible to analyze public interest in scientific discovery in accordance to their health status – making it possible to increase participatory science and enable users from across regions to collaborate based on their personalized health profiles.",
		"screen6" : "<h3>Digital Health is Social</h3>Jastr will not only make social search inherent in our algorithms based on search history but also through similar health profiles. By virtue of enabling cohorts of similar genetic profiles to enter clinical trials, Jastr will push forward discovery. Rather than deployments of hundred million dollar funds, scientific discovery will build personalized therapeutics for small pools of personnel.",
		"screen7" : "<h3>Value-Based Care</h3>Jastr’s model for value-based care is applicable on all levels of care, as well as the embedded experiences we create. Clinical trials will be ranked and valued based on the same meta platform but further adjusted when a consumer enters this service.",
		"screen8" : "<h3>Managed Financials</h3>Payments are enabled because insurance is a barrier to clinical trials – they usually never cover experimental clinical trials and if a consumer consumes experimental procedures when they are gambling for life and death, that cost is usually never pre-planned or broken down into reoccurring figures. Jastr will help aggregate health plans based on payment method preferences.",
