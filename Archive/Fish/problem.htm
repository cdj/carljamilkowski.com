  <div class="feature">    <p><img src="images/lab1.jpg" width="450" height="264">The current state of underwater locomotion is inefficient compared to biological systems. The vehicles in use now, such as submarines, are wasteful and have poor maneuverability. Humans are unable to explore the depths of the oceans due to these shortcomings. Many advances in power and propulsion have been made for both land and air travel, but very few apply to underwater use. Fish perform the best underwater travel, and for this reason a design mimicking many of the traits of a certain class of fish movement, the carangiform, will be investigated. This mode of locomotion provides the best design for efficiency and will be the simplest to model [<a href="references.htm#6">6</a>]. </p>
      <p>Moreover, this project is motivated by the lack of knowledge of sensing and control used by fish. There is no current robotic fish that lends itself directly to flow sensing. There are a number of other actuated fish that have been created, but none of these are designed with data acquisition and control in mind. This concept, coupled with the investigation of the numerous types of available actuators, has forced the immediate need for redesign of current underwater autonomous vehicles. </p>
      <p>There is currently an infrastructure designed specifically for this project in 49MEB. The proposed robotic fish design will mesh with the existing available equipment, and allow for further research of flow and control. The infrastructure consists of a swimming pool in which the fish will be tested and a system that will determine the fish&rsquo;s position in the pool. MATLAB and Quanser WinCon software will be used to control the fish. </p>
