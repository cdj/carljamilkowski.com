  <div class="feature">    <p>The goal of this project is to create a closed loop, autonomous robot that will simulate ideal aquatic motion using underwater flow sensing. The flow sensing will be used to maximize swimming efficiency through different flows of water. In the end, the robot will be controlled using MATLAB or similar software, while receiving outputs from the flow sensors. </p>

        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/link.gif" width="294" height="132">The objective is to design and build a robot simulating the motion of a carangiform fish that can implement closed loop control. The motion will be replicated using a three-degree of freedom system having a full motion frequency of one hertz. In addition, the robot will have full range and asymmetric motion to allow the robot to make turns. The length of the fish is expected to be around 1.5 feet and the tail will be able to deflect a total of 60&#730; from the neutral axis.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/joystick2.jpg" width="300" height="174">Certain issues of waterproofing, buoyancy, and mass balance must also be addressed to ensure accurate carangiform swimming. Compatibility with the existing equipment is important. A frame sits around the pool, allowing for tubing or wires to connect to the robot via a vertically hanging joystick device. This device (pictured on left) was the product of the Senior Design team from the previous semester. The joystick will fix the robot&rsquo;s vertical position in the pool, constraining this project to a 2D problem. Also, with the electrical sensors and actuators it is important to ensure a waterproof body to prevent electrical parts from failing. Not only should the body be waterproof, but it should also mimic the shape of a fish to create an accurate flow, including areas around the body of the fish and the vortices behind it.</td>
