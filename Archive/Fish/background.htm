  <div class="feature"><p>During the past fifty years much progress has been made in the area of fluid mechanics, leading to a better understanding of fish locomotion. Thorough studies have been made of fish body structures and how their movements affect swimming. Experiments to find the drag coefficient and Reynolds number of fish bodies have been undertaken and the results can be easily found in a variety of fish mechanics books [<a href="references.htm#3">3</a>]. The efficiency, tail frequency, and movements of swimming fish are well-documented [<a href="references.htm#3">3</a>]. The biology of fish is very important in developing an accurate model. Most of the biological and mechanical information needed to construct a reasonable mechanical fish can be found in the university Library of Biology. Many of these traits will be incorporated into this design. Although no specific fish will be modeled, the physical features of the final design will be compared to that of a fish of similar size and shape. The general shape and movements of the carangiform swimming mode, along with the dimensionless the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers for that fish will be incorporated into the design. </p>

        <p> The long-term goal of this project is to have a robotic fish that can maneuver itself in a tank by taking advantage of flows and body positions, leading to very efficient underwater locomotion. At this point minimal research has been done in this area. Professor Perry Li from the University of Minnesota did some research on the control of underwater robotics, specifically with energy efficiency in mind [<a href="references.htm#4">4</a>,<a href="references.htm#5">5</a>]. The design of a robotic fish will allow for further research in hydrodynamic efficiency, and closed loop control pertaining to underwater locomotion. </p></td>

        <td><a href="references.htm#2"><img src="images/swim.fishcentric.gif" width="260" height="129" border="0"></a>Scientists at MIT and Harvard performed an analysis of fish in a fluid flow with vortices present [<a href="references.htm#2">2</a>]. They found that the fish exploited the behavior of the vortices to reduce the power cost of maintaining a position in the flow. This was achieved by slaloming between the vortices. Electromyography (EMG) was performed on the fish while performing this feat and it was discovered that only the anterior axial muscles (directly behind the head) were being used. This project seeks to eventually simulate this behavior with the use of sensory input about the fluid flow.</td>

        <td><a href="references.htm#1"><img src="images/haircell.jpg" width="347" height="260" border="0"></a>One of the goals of this project is to design for eventual integration of sensors so that the robotic fish may better interact with its environment. The sensors of interest are &ldquo;hair cell&rdquo; sensors [<a href="references.htm#1">1</a>] currently in development at the MNTL at this university. These biomimetic devices are based on the lateral-line sensory organs of real fish and stretch along the length of the fish&rsquo;s body. There are two types of lateral lines: one, a tube filled with cilia with several openings to the outside environment, and the other a line of grouped hair cells of varying height that are largely one dimensional in their sensing capabilities. These sensors are based off of the latter. Manufactured on a silicon substrate the hair cells sit at the end of a cantilever beam structure where their deflection can be measured. It is reported that the sensors can be made long enough to extend into the boundary layer flow. A thin Parylene film covers the device, insulating it and allowing for it to be operated in conducting fluids. The current implementation needs modification to be operated in a more distributed rather than centralized form. </td>
