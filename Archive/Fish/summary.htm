      <p>Biomimetic research has the ultimate goal of harnessing biological advantages. This project in particular will ultimately mimic the efficient swimming traits of fish. Of the many different types of efficient swimming are available, one was selected and will be modeled. In achieving an effective simulation of the biological systems, a survey of actuator technologies, followed by the implementation and optimization of a chosen one will take place. As part of a larger project, the design must be able to serve as a platform for concurrent and future work while also integrating the existing laboratory infrastructure. This project will produce a system for testing control algorithms that utilize a novel biomimetic flow sensing system. The larger implications of such a system can be extended to robust autonomous vehicles that enjoy increased efficiency and therefore require less fuel, allowing a larger payload. This knowledge of controls and efficiency could also eventually be used in grouped form for collective benefits, such as in schools of fish.</p>
      <p>The project will move forward with a vigorous study of actuation systems that accurately simulate the biological model chosen. Several different options will be discussed and testing will commence. At this point in the project, this group&rsquo;s work is largely independent of the rest of the fish research group&rsquo;s work, but the two are expected to become progressively more interdependent.</p>
