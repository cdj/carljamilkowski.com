  <div class="feature">    <p> <a href="references.htm#10"><img src="images/swim.aquacentric.gif" width="350" height="175" border="0"></a>Over seventy-five percent of the earth&rsquo;s surface is covered in water, but humans have been unable to explore most of it due to primitive submersive methods of control, sensing, and propulsion. Marine animals are able to explore and live in these regions without problems. They have been able to adapt ideal forms of locomotion.</p>
    <p>This Senior Design Project for the <a href="http://www.mie.uiuc.edu">Mechanical Engineering Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois</a> will concentrate on the creation of an actuator system that will duplicate the caudal fin, or tail, of a fish. This actuator will be controlled through MATLAB using Quanser WinCon software. The prototype fish will then be tested in Professor Kelly&rsquo;s lab in 49MEB at the <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois</a>. This project is a part of a larger group's work, NABLa (Not A Biomimetics Lab), to create a biomimetic robotic rish that can accept control algorithms from a computer and input from flow sensors to efficiently navigate a fluid flow in the presence of vortices. Professor Scott Kelly runs the group and is the client for this project. </p>
    <p> There are a number of academic and commercial laboratories working on flexible fishlike fins, but none of their designs has emerged as a standard. Although there are other similar projects, none of them being executed with sensing in mind. Consequently, a three-degree of freedom fin will be made. The motion of the fin will be modeled after the carangiform mode of fish locomotion, and the design will keep sensing and controllability in mind. Specifically, the final robotic fish will be fitted with hair cell sensors, allowing for a closed-loop control system to be developed. </p>
      <p>This study will lead to a better understanding of how fish swim with such agility and efficiency, and will eventually lead to new technology for underwater propulsion, and steering.</p>
