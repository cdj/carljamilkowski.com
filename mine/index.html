    <h2>Mine</h2>
    <p>Mine is a service that allows you to see yourself like data-miners see you. It is about giving users insight into how their data is viewed by others. We split this into two realms: <span style="font-weight:bold">how individuals see you</span> (e.g. Facebook, employers), and <span style="font-weight:bold">how machines see you</span> (the NSA, advertisers, etc.). My team developed the project in a class taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky" target="_blank">Clay Shirky</a> at <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp" target="_blank">NYU ITP</a>.</p>
    <div class="prompt">Given the available data, what can we invent that would improve the lives of individuals?</div>

    <p>Things started converging on how people are perceived through social media:</p>
    <div class="brainstorm">How insurable are you?<br>
        How does what you do online affect insurance premiums?<br>
        actuarial tables<br>
        How employable are you? <br>

        Ex's: Photos of you &amp; friends with red drink cups, check-ins at McD's, photos of pork chops with gravy, etc.
        Users?  (1)People intrigued, amused, horrified with seeing their info and photos interpreted by power-wielding 3rd parties in ways they can only control by limiting all info they share (2) Third parties?

        dateability
        credit rating</p>

        <p>Where would we find the data?

        actuarial table
        employability
        hr experts
        dateability
        academic journals/studies

        <p>Companies are getting more active in pursuing your social media information, and more specific in their analyses of it. Through everything you post now, someone thinks they are making an informed decision about you and the personal details of your life. Not only is the process hidden from you, the information that is being used could be wrong.</p>
        <p>Data mining is not a problem or a threat - it's a new reality. People need a buffer, allowing them to reflect upon their social media information before it hits the general public. Mine informs you about the types of conclusions data mining companies make about you, and gives you a chance to change that. In a world where no online information is truly private, and one misjudged bit of info can collapse your hopes and dreams, let Mine be your canary.</p>
