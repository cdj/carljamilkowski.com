    <h2>Mine</h2>
    <p>Mine is a service that allows you to see yourself like data-miners see you. It is about giving users insight into how their data is viewed by others. We split this into two realms: <span style="font-weight:bold">how individuals see you</span> (e.g. Facebook, employers), and <span style="font-weight:bold">how machines see you</span> (the NSA, advertisers, etc.). My team developed the project in a class taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky" target="_blank">Clay Shirky</a> at <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp" target="_blank">NYU ITP</a>.</p>
    <div class="prompt"><h3>Prompt:</h3><p>Given the available data, what can we invent that would improve the lives of individuals?</p></div>
    <p>The class was part of an international design competition sponsored by Microsoft Research, “Design Expo – Making Data Useful: Improving Your Life, Community, and World.” We competed against other teams in our class, then proceeded to compete against other schools on-site in Redmond. We took an iterative approach, apparent below, that allowed us to refine the design and message over time. Given the prompt above, we started to imagine how we could use data to help the individual.</p>

        <p>Companies are getting more active in pursuing your social media information, and more specific in their analyses of it. Through everything you post now, someone thinks they are making an informed decision about you and the personal details of your life. Not only is the process hidden from you, the information that is being used could be wrong.</p>
        <p>Data mining is not a problem or a threat - it's a new reality. People need a buffer, allowing them to reflect upon their social media information before it hits the general public. Mine informs you about the types of conclusions data mining companies make about you, and gives you a chance to change that. In a world where no online information is truly private, and one misjudged bit of info can collapse your hopes and dreams, let Mine be your canary.</p>
